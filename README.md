## Usage 

The Player is prompted to begin the game, at which point questions are loaded one by one for the player to answer.
The game ends when the player runs out of time or they reach the end of the question set.
The player then is prompted to entier their name to save their score on a separate page. The player can view the list of recent scores, clear the list or go back to the beginning page to start the game again.

The order of questions and the list of possible answers are randomized each time to prevent repetitive play.
